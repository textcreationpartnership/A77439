            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>On <hi>February</hi> the <hi>6th.</hi> 1684. King <hi>Charles</hi> the II. Died. And on the ≈øame day was Proclaimed <hi>James</hi> the II. as His only Brother, and Heir. And afterwards King <hi>James</hi> the <hi>Second</hi> having confirmed all Officers in Place as were before, came into the Privy-Council Chamber, and ≈øpake, ≈øaying to this effect as follows; <hi>[That He would follow His Brothers Example in Clemency and Tenderne≈øs to His People.

            </p>
            <p>This Speech by the King's Command was made Publick. How He hath kept His Royal Word, God knows, it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cometh not me to ≈øay.</p>
            <p>On <hi>February the 11th.</hi> came in the fir≈øt Addre≈øs from <hi>Port≈ømouth</hi> Garri≈øon, and the Society of <hi>Lincolns Inn,</hi> Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratulating His Maje≈øties Acce≈ø≈øion to the Throne, and promi≈øing Obedience.

            <p>Henceforward followed Addre≈ø≈øes from all Counties and mo≈øt of the Great Towns all over <hi>England, Scotland</hi> and <hi>Ireland,</hi> and from mo≈øt Parts of His Maje≈øties Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions.

            <p>On <hi>June</hi> the <hi>13th.</hi> the Duke of <hi>Monmouth,</hi> with two or three ≈ømall Ve≈ø≈øels, loaded with a good quantity of Arms, and a few Men, Landed at <hi>Lyme</hi> in <hi>Dor≈øet-≈øhire.</hi> But again≈øt him al≈øo the <hi>Parliament</hi> unanimou≈øly joyned with the King, and giving Him Money to rai≈øe an Army, Declared the Duke of <hi>Monmouth</hi> Traytor by <hi>Act of Parliament.</hi> But the Duke encrea≈øing his Army mightily at <hi>Taunton</hi> in <hi>Somer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øet-≈øhire;</hi> managed his Affairs with a notable Conduct and
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:152569:4"/>Courage: But finally at <hi>Wells</hi> his Army beginning to Plun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, and to break out into Debauchery, he ≈øoon after Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ri≈øhed in a Pitch't Battel, ≈øome Three miles from <hi>Bridgewa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter;</hi> where being wor≈øted for want of good Hor≈øe-men.

But the L‚Äîd G‚Äî<hi>y</hi> being al≈øo Taken, Confe≈ø≈øed the Confederates, and was Saved.</p>
            <p>On <hi>July</hi> the <hi>12th.</hi> was a day of Thank≈øgiving for the Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce≈øs of the≈øe Victories. <hi>Richard Goodenough</hi> was al≈øo Taken, who after confe≈ø≈øed the Accomplices, and ≈øaved his Life.

The Lord <hi>Delamere,</hi> Earl of <hi>Stam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford,</hi> and Lord <hi>Brandon,</hi> were made Pri≈øoners.</p>
            <p>From the≈øe ≈øtirs of Civil Wars, it came to pa≈øs that a ≈øtanding Army was ever after kept up by the King, and the <hi>Parliament</hi> Adjourned and Prorogued from time to time, it was paid out of the King's own Revenues. And hence <hi>Popery</hi> encrea≈øed with much advance, the Queen and one Father <hi>Petre,</hi> much ≈øpurring on.</p>
            <p>On <hi>November</hi> the <hi>9th.</hi> the <hi>Parliament</hi> met at <hi>Westmin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øter,</hi> according to Adjournment; at what time the King excu≈øing His Standing-Army kept up, and ≈øeveral Officers allowed again≈øt Law, who had not taken the <hi>Te≈øt.</hi> The <hi>Parliament</hi> not plea≈øed herewith, were ≈øoon Prorogued.</p>
            <p>On <hi>March</hi> the <hi>11th.</hi> came forth His Maje≈øties Procla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of <hi>General Pardon,</hi> not without many Excepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</p>
            <p>1686. In the Army Popi≈øh Officers by degrees filled all vacant Places: As al≈øo <hi>French</hi> and <hi>Iri≈øh</hi> Popi≈øh Souldiers mingled in mo≈øt Troops and Companies. <hi>Papi≈øts</hi> al≈øo were admitted into Privy-Council; were made Judges, Sheriffs and Ju≈øtices, without taking the <hi>Te≈øt.</hi> And in <hi>February,</hi> 1686. the Earl of <hi>Tyrconnel</hi> a great <hi>Papi≈øt,</hi> Succeeded the Earl of <hi>Clarendon,</hi> Lieutenant of <hi>Ireland.</hi> And the Earl of <hi>Roche≈øter</hi>
               <pb n="6" facs="tcp:152569:5"/>refu≈øing to become a <hi>Papi≈øt,</hi> was put out of Place of High Trea≈øurer.</p>
            <p>On <hi>February</hi> the <hi>24th.</hi> was Publi≈øhed His Maje≈øties Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamation for Liberty of Con≈øcience to <hi>Papi≈øts,</hi> and all others as could be tru≈øted in the Kingdom of <hi>Scotland.</hi> For which the Lords of the Privy-Council of that Kingdom, returned their Thanks. Thus His Maje≈øty by uniting the <hi>Popi≈øh</hi> and <hi>Presbyterian</hi> Intere≈øt in <hi>Scotland,</hi> began to le≈ø≈øen the Authority of the then pre≈øent e≈øtabli≈øhed Church by Prote≈øtant Bi≈øhops.</p>
            <p>By this time the Deputy of <hi>Ireland</hi> being become a <hi>Papi≈øt,</hi> and much of the Council; the Army there; the Sheriffs, Judges and Ju≈øtices al≈øo being mo≈øtly <hi>Popi≈øh,</hi> or Popi≈øhly affected, Per≈øons in Popi≈øh Rebells E≈øtates began to be thru≈øt out apace, even by Law too, by means of tho≈øe Judges and Sheriffs; and Popi≈øh Robbers al≈øo multiplied, in≈øomuch as little ≈øafety for Prote≈øtants began to appear in that King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom.

            </p>
            <p>On <hi>March</hi> the <hi>18th.</hi> His Maje≈øty declared His intention to grant <hi>Liberty of Con≈øcience</hi> unto all Per≈øons of what Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øwa≈øion ≈øoever: And the better to Father His de≈øign, He Prorogued the <hi>Parliament</hi> to <hi>November</hi> 87.

            <p>Hence followed a crowd of Congratulatory Addre≈ø≈øes, from all ≈øorts of Di≈ø≈øenters.

            <p>Such were the whileom thoughts of the <hi>Anabaptists,</hi> of King <hi>James,</hi> notwith≈øtanding all His endeavours of advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing Popery, who appeared in this Addre≈øs,</p>

            <p>They pretend to <hi>have an ab≈øolute Confidence</hi> in King <hi>James,</hi> as to His tender care of the Peace and quiet of His Subjects; they pretend <hi>to ≈øtrive again≈øt all Di≈ø≈øen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters with Emulation,</hi> to <hi>do more for Him than all of them.</hi> They pretend <hi>to be bound to Wi≈øh, Pray, and Fight, and to do all that may be done,</hi> that <hi>His Maje≈øty</hi> and the <hi>Prince of</hi> Wales <hi>His Son,</hi> and <hi>His Government may be Ble≈ø≈øed.</hi> And ≈øo by con≈øequence they mu≈øt hold, that all oppo≈øers ought to be Accur≈øed.

            <p>On <hi>May</hi> the <hi>28th.</hi> was pre≈øented to His Maje≈øty the Humble Addre≈øs of the <hi>Anabaptists</hi> of the City of <hi>Bristol;</hi> acknowledging, promi≈øing, and wi≈øhing much after the manner as tho≈øe before.</p>
            <p>On <hi>June</hi> the <hi>18th.</hi> was Pre≈øented the Humble Addre≈øs of the <hi>Anabaptists</hi> of <hi>Kent,</hi> acknowledging, promi≈øing and wi≈øhing like their preceeding Brethren; acknowledging the King, though a <hi>(Zealous Papist)</hi> yet the <hi>most tender and affectionate Prince that ever ≈øway'd the Scepter of His Empire;</hi> out-doing <hi>all expectation and de≈øert of His Subjects;</hi> promi≈øing <hi>Submi≈ø≈øion to Him under God,</hi> and <hi>that unfeignedly, in all things commanded them by Him;</hi> Praying that God may grant Him <hi>what≈øoever may be needful,</hi> for His then pre≈øent and future Happine≈øs.</p>
            <p>On <hi>June</hi> the <hi>29th.</hi> was Pre≈øented to His Maje≈øty the Humble Addre≈øs of the <hi>Anabaptists</hi> of <hi>Middle≈øex, Hertford, Bucks, Oxon, Warwick, Northampton, Lincoln, Huntington, Bedford, Cambridge, E≈ø≈øex, Kent Surry, Su≈ø≈øex, Southampton</hi> and <hi>Dor≈øet-≈øhires,</hi> Confirming with very Hyperbolical Compli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, all things afore promi≈øed and owned by the re≈øt of Their preceding Brethren.</p>
            <p>And after all the≈øe was pre≈øented, yet one more Humble Addre≈øs of the <hi>Anabaptists</hi> of <hi>Oxford, Abbington,</hi> and <hi>Wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage,</hi> with the ≈øame Flatteries and Warranties as their Fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows.

            <p>And by all the≈øe Addre≈ø≈øes, it appears plainly, that not only the mo≈øt part, if not all the <hi>Anabaptists</hi> in and about <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,</hi> but all over <hi>England,</hi> have voluntarily and freely engaged them≈øelves unto their utmo≈øt to aid and a≈ø≈øi≈øt King <hi>James</hi> in taking off the <hi>Test</hi> and all <hi>Poenal Laws;</hi> and by con≈øe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence to open the ancient Floud gates of Stoppage, and to let in an Inundation of Popery, to over-run and drown not only the <hi>Church of England,</hi> but al≈øo the whole King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, with an overflow of Popi≈øh Oppre≈ø≈øions.</p>
            <p>Now true it is, that <hi>Liberty of Con≈øcience</hi> is a matter not rea≈øonably of any Power to be denied unto any of its Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, and cannot be ≈øpoken again≈øt. But <hi>Liberty of Schi≈øm</hi> is quite another thing, and ≈øuch as Holy Writ utterly Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hors. It is the will of God [<hi>that all Chri≈øtians be of one mind, Eph.</hi> 4.1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.10.] And we know what an <hi>heinous thing</hi> it was e≈øteemed by St. <hi>Paul,</hi> [That <hi>there were Divi≈øions in the Church, the Members dividing and ≈øeparating into Parties,</hi> (ver. 11, 12, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>)] And the≈øe things both Magi≈øtrates and Mini≈øters ought to remedy to the be≈øt of their skill. And in Old times they were always e≈øteemed <hi>good Kings</hi> who puni≈øhed <hi>Innovations</hi> in Religion, and that with Severity. And the Apo≈øtles in the <hi>New Testament</hi> were as urgent to the ≈øame purpo≈øe, [to reject all <hi>Hereticks,</hi> (<hi>Tit.</hi> 3.10.2 <hi>Joh.</hi> ver. 9, 10, 11. and 3 <hi>Joh.</hi> ver. 9, 10.)] Such <hi>Paul</hi> accur≈øeth, (<hi>Gal.</hi> 1.8.) And wi≈øheth ≈øuch Perverters who <hi>trouble the Church,</hi> that they might <hi>be cut off,</hi> (<hi>Gal.</hi> 5.12.)</p>
            <p>Con≈øider we therefore, that the <hi>Anabapti≈øts,</hi> being a perni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious ≈øort of People, dangerous both to Church and State, wherever they have crept into Power: As was manife≈øt at <hi>Am≈øterdam,</hi> and after at <hi>Mun≈øter</hi> in <hi>Germany,</hi> and ≈øince in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> in times of the late Rebellion: And are a Sect that do hold Dectrines de≈øtructive to the Peace of Church and State, denying the Power of the <hi>Civil Magi≈øtrate</hi> in many things;
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:152569:7"/>and do maintain <hi>a Church again≈øt a Church,</hi> and <hi>Altar against Altar</hi> in the ≈øame Church; and ≈øet up <hi>Lay Preachers,</hi> and maintain <hi>Re-baptizing.</hi> All which Doctrines, being by the General Councils in pure≈øt Primitive times <hi>Forbidden,</hi> and <hi>Accur≈øed</hi> and declared to be <hi>Schi≈ømatical</hi> and <hi>Haeretical,</hi> can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be called matters of Con≈øcience, no more than <hi>Theft</hi> and <hi>Fornication</hi> can be ≈øo called.

And all <hi>Schi≈øm</hi> is by the Magi≈øtrate to be puni≈øhed equally with Murther and Adultery, and therefore not to be Tolerated. And yet we ≈øee how friendly the≈øe Haereticks and Schi≈øma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks, the <hi>Anabapti≈øts and Papists</hi> do Hug each other; no Hand and Glove did ever better fit one the other.</p>
            <p>It was ≈øix Weeks after the <hi>Anabapti≈øts</hi> e'er any other Sect advanced, the poor Men of the <hi>West</hi> only excepted, (who being Pardoned their Lives, had ju≈øt cau≈øe to be thankful.)

<pb n="27" facs="tcp:152569:15"/>in the Dioece≈øs of <hi>Durham</hi> and <hi>Che≈øter.</hi> This <hi>July</hi> the <hi>1≈øt.</hi> And on the <hi>5th.</hi> was publick that of the <hi>Dean and Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of Rippon in York-≈øhire.</hi> Then followed that of the <hi>Bi≈øhop and Clergy of the Dioece≈øs</hi> of <hi>Coventry</hi> and <hi>Litchfield, July 9th.</hi> And la≈øtly, though long fir≈øt, came out the <hi>Addre≈øs of the Bi≈øhop and Clergy of the Dioce≈øs of St.</hi> Davids: (that is, of the new made Bi≈øhop, for it ≈øeems the Dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Bi≈øhop was not for it) Now all the≈øe Church-men wrote after one Copy, which was from <hi>Durham.</hi> There was al≈øo an Addre≈øs of certain pretended Church-men of the City of <hi>London;</hi> but it was only a name of what was not, by ≈øome certain pretenders. And indeed all the five <hi>Epi≈øcopal Addre≈ø≈øers,</hi> though true <hi>Bi≈øhops,</hi> yet were but pretended Church-men, while they became perfect <hi>Pillars</hi> of <hi>Popery.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>La≈øtly, after all the re≈øt had begun, the ≈øixth and la≈øt, and main <hi>Pillar</hi> of <hi>Popery</hi> pre≈øented it ≈øelf, <hi>The Hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Addre≈øs of His Maje≈øties Roman Catholick Subjects,</hi> which appeared <hi>May</hi> the <hi>28th.</hi> Now, whatever the re≈øt were, the≈øe were certainly in earne≈øt in all their acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, applau≈øes, promi≈øes and good wi≈øhes. But what is mo≈øt remarkable in their Addre≈øs is, that they ≈øay, <hi>[That they can do no le≈øs than thank God and His Maje≈øty, for ≈øuch an happy Expedient as His Declaration for Liberty of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øcience, for the ea≈øe and comfort of all His loving Subjects.]</hi> Now, it is again≈øt the profe≈øt Principles of the <hi>Roman-Catholick Religion</hi> to allow <hi>Liberty of Con≈øcience</hi> in matters of <hi>Haere≈øie and Schi≈øm,</hi> as they do e≈øteem all <hi>Presbyterians</hi> and <hi>Anabapti≈øts, Quakers</hi> and <hi>Independents</hi> to be ≈øuch. And in truth it is no wonder, that they who count it a Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple of their Religion to <hi>Aequivocate,</hi> or in plain terms to <hi>Lie for advantage,</hi> can admit it into their practice to comply with the <hi>wor≈øt of Hereticks</hi> in order to carry on their De≈øign, in breaking down the good Laws which are the ≈øence of the <hi>Church of England.</hi> And this they may as aptly con≈øent to do, as practically to di≈ø≈øemble them≈øelves to be <hi>Quakers</hi> among the <hi>Quakers,</hi> and <hi>Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bapti≈øts</hi> among the <hi>Anabapti≈øts,</hi> in order to increa≈øe <hi>Schi≈øm</hi>
               <pb n="28" facs="tcp:152569:16"/>and <hi>Here≈øie</hi> in a ≈øtrange Church, that they may with the more ≈øafety e≈øtabli≈øh that great <hi>Schi≈øme</hi> of their own, <hi>Popery.</hi> And thus we find the <hi>Roman-Catholicks,</hi> the <hi>Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bapti≈øts,</hi> the <hi>Presbyterians, Quakers; Independents,</hi> and <hi>Popi≈øhly inclined Church-men,</hi> all link'd together in as fa≈øt a Bond of Friend≈øhip, as faith and truth by Vows and Promi≈øes can tye them together, in furthering the <hi>Declaration</hi> and <hi>De≈øign</hi> of E≈øtabli≈øhing <hi>Liberty of Con≈øcience</hi> upon the Ba≈øis of <hi>Here≈øie</hi> and <hi>Schi≈øm;</hi> and finally to introduce <hi>Popery.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now after this Foundation laid, wherever any of the≈øe Six ≈øorts of <hi>Papi≈øh Pillar-men</hi> got in to be a <hi>Mayor of a Corporation,</hi> thence immediately followed an Addre≈øs from <hi>that Corporation,</hi> to the ≈øame effect as each Sect had afore Addre≈ø≈øed. But hitherto His Maje≈øty had tran≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gre≈ø≈øed no Laws, excepting that he had admitted <hi>Popi≈øh Officers</hi> into the Army, and into other Places of Tru≈øt, for which He pleaded <hi>Nece≈ø≈øity.</hi> However the <hi>Parliament</hi> then in force, not approving thereof, was Di≈ø≈øolved af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter two Adjournments, and ten Prorogations in effectual, was finally Di≈ø≈øolved <hi>July 2d.</hi> 1687. Notwith≈øtanding Nece≈ø≈øity had no Law; that putting in of <hi>Popi≈øh Officers</hi> in all Places of Tru≈øt was to be born with. On <hi>Febru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ary 12th.</hi> 1686, the Earl of <hi>Clarendon</hi> being Removed, the Earl of <hi>Tyrconnel</hi> was ≈øettled Lord Lieutenant of <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</hi> And on <hi>March 11th. Henry Lord Arundel of Wardour</hi> a Papi≈øt, was made <hi>Lord Privy Seal.</hi> About the ≈øame time, or before, the <hi>Earl of Roche≈øter,</hi> Uncle to the King's two Daughters, for ≈øtanding firm to the <hi>Prote≈øtant Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion</hi> according to the <hi>Church of England,</hi> was removed out of Place from being <hi>Lord Trea≈øurer,</hi> and the Place put into Commi≈ø≈øioners hands Popi≈øhly inclined: And the Earl of <hi>Sunderland</hi> a <hi>Papi≈øt,</hi> was made Lord Pre≈øident of the Council. On <hi>February 8th.</hi> the Lord <hi>Ca≈øtlemain,</hi> His Maje≈øties <hi>Amba≈ø≈øador</hi> to the <hi>Pope,</hi> had Audience. But after the <hi>Addre≈ø≈øes</hi> once began to come in thick, then the King ventur'd to receive a <hi>Publick Amba≈ø≈øador from the Pope, with all the Honours and Ceremonies u≈øually ob≈øerved on the like Occa≈øion:</hi> This was done at <hi>Wind≈øor,</hi> on <hi>July
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:152569:16"/>5th.</hi> 1687. And on <hi>November 11th.</hi> Father <hi>Petre</hi> the King's Confe≈ø≈øor and Clerk of the Clo≈øet, was Sworn of His Maje≈øties Privy-Council, and took his Place at the Board. And on <hi>November 17th.</hi> was publi≈øhed a Book called, <hi>An Agreement between the Church of England and Church of Rome, Evinced from the Concertation of ≈øome of her Sons, with their Brethren the Di≈ø≈øenters.</hi> Such was the Fruit of the <hi>Addre≈ø≈øes</hi> made by the <hi>Sir Pillars</hi> of Pope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry. On <hi>December 11th.</hi> His Maje≈øty being encouraged by the abundance of <hi>Addre≈ø≈øes,</hi> began to view the Li≈øt of His <hi>Ju≈øtices of the Peace</hi> in all the Counties, and of the <hi>Deputy Lieutenants,</hi> and to turn out of Place all ≈øuch as would not be for His Declaration of <hi>Liberty of Con≈øcience,</hi> and for taking off the <hi>Penal Laws and Te≈øt.</hi> Whence great numbers in all Counties were turned out, and <hi>Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naticks, Papi≈øts,</hi> and <hi>popi≈øhly inclined Per≈øons,</hi> came into Place. And about the ≈øame time, or ≈øoon after, all Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porations were Regulated by ab≈øolute Power, and all Men adhering to the Law were turned out, and <hi>Phana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks, Papi≈øts,</hi> and <hi>popi≈øhly inclined Per≈øons</hi> were put in place. And hence it came to pa≈øs that all the Corporations in <hi>London</hi> became Regulated, and filled with <hi>Hereticks</hi> and <hi>Schi≈ømaticks;</hi> whence followed infinite <hi>Addre≈ø≈øes</hi> from all the≈øe New <hi>Corporations,</hi> and from all the New Model'd Companies. After this it was that the <hi>Eccle≈øia≈øtical Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mi≈ø≈øioners</hi> had been put in power, and had begun to exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute great power of Oppre≈ø≈øion over many of His Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øties Con≈øciencious Subjects. The Right Reverend Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in God, the Lord <hi>Bi≈øhop of London,</hi> beloved of mo≈øt Men for his Fatherly care of the Church, again≈øt all Law and Rea≈øon had been Su≈øpended. And on <hi>December 10th.</hi> The <hi>Pre≈øident and Fellows of Magdalen Colledge in Oxford,</hi> again≈øt <hi>all Law and Con≈øcience</hi> were <hi>decreed</hi> and <hi>pronounced</hi> uncapable of being admitted into any <hi>Eccle≈øia≈øtical Dignity.</hi> The≈øe by force appointed by the <hi>Commi≈ø≈øioners,</hi> contrary to all Rules of Law, had been turned out of their Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holds on the <hi>30th.</hi> of <hi>November</hi> before.

And the King pre≈øuming upon the ≈øtrength of the <hi>Pillars,</hi> was meerly drawn in and encouraged, beyond all His hope at His Coronation, when he fir≈øt promi≈øed, and then Swore, to defend and maintain the <hi>Laws</hi> of the Land. Whence it may be ≈øafely maintain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that wherein ≈øoever His Maje≈øty hath acted again≈øt Law, as is now generally alledged, contrary to his Oaths and Promi≈øes, although the Breach was really His own proper act, yet the greate≈øt blame thereof, lyes at their Doors, who by pleading Con≈øcience to do the greate≈øt Wickedne≈øs, drew him in to comply with them; and by promi≈øing to ≈øtand by and a≈ø≈øi≈øt hiw to the la≈øt Breath, encouraged him to do what otherwi≈øe in all likelyhood He never had intended. For when it was declared by His Maje≈øty on <hi>April</hi> the <hi>27th.</hi> 1688, what was <hi>His Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>je≈øties further will and plea≈øure</hi> concerning His <hi>Declaration of Indulgence,</hi> He ≈øaid expre≈øly. <hi>[We are encouraged by mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titudes of Addre≈ø≈øes, and by many other A≈ø≈øuances we receive from Our Subjects of all Per≈øwa≈øions, as Te≈øtimonies of their Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction and Duty, to ≈øee it pre≈øerved without Di≈øtinction.]</hi> And in the ≈øame Declaration he further ≈øaith, [<hi>In pur≈øuance of this we have been forced to make many Changet both of Civil and Military Officers throughout our Dominions,</hi> &amp;c.] Whence it fully appears, that what by means of the <hi>Addre≈ø≈øes</hi> and by means of <hi>private A≈ø≈øurances</hi> from the Parties Addre≈ø≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:152569:17"/>before the Addre≈ø≈øes came forth, His Maje≈øty was un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happily drawn in to do all tho≈øe things which are counted ill, ever ≈øince his Reign.

            <p>Hence followed the Orders i≈ø≈øued forth, directed unto the <hi>Arch bi≈øhops, Bi≈øhops,</hi> and the <hi>Clergy,</hi> to read the King's Declaration in all their Provinces, <hi>Dioece≈ø≈øes</hi> and <hi>Churches</hi> therein.
